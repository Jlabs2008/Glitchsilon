Lambda OS is an open source alternitive to Epslon for Numworks calculators.

Lambda adds meny features that are missing from Epslon such a CAS, RPN(Reverse Polish Notation Calculator), and even a plugin installer!

## Disclaimer

Contributers to Lambda OS are not in anyway responsible for Damage caused to your calculator. Some features such as the CAS might not be allowed on tests. If any features on this OS are used for cheating we are in no way responsible. To insure ceating is prevented a spalsh screen will warn that the student is running unoffical software. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

## Installing
Lambda os works by installing a false update to the calculator. After it's installed it will attempt to wipe the previous update. This update MUST be compiled by your self due to Numworks TOS. Though compiling is very easy to do. Google is your friend. After you compile the OS, download falseWorks and follow the setup to installing the false update.
